= Calcium diffusion from CRAC channels in a microdomain  =

Welcome to the Chaste wiki.

This section contains pages generated automatically from the source code accompanying Capel et al. (2014).

Before running these examples you will need to [wiki:InstallGuides/InstallGuide install Chaste's dependencies] 
and the [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html source code for version 3.3].
The easiest way to do this is using an Ubuntu machine (or an Ubuntu virtual machine) as discussed on InstallGuides/UbuntuPackage.
Note that cardiac Chaste is not supported on Windows, so users of Windows will need to follow the virtual machine route.
For manual installation of each dependency, on any version of Linux, see DeveloperInstallGuide.

The simulations featured in the paper supplement are explained and annotated below.
For further information on using Chaste to solve these and related problems, see our [wiki:ChasteGuides extensive guide material].

== Diffusion study ==

The steps required to reproduce the study are given in the following tutorial file: [wiki:./CaDiffusion C++ file for performing simulation].

== Sample commands to run everything ==

To run the simulations, use:
{{{
#!sh
cd <path/to/Chaste>
scons chaste_libs=1 brief=1 build=GccOptNative projects/CaDiffusion
}}}
